Kafka Message Format:
	{"url":"", "video_id":"", "time_stamp":"", "inner":false, "type":0}
	Such as:
	{"url": "http://f.hiphotos.baidu.com/image/pic/item/060828381f30e924bd73bbdf48086e061c95f70c.jpg","video_id": "test","time_stamp": "0","inner": false,"type", 0}

Problem:
1. How to invoke python with external modules 'thrift' in java to search similar images.
2. How to publish search results.
3. How to record image features and search results.
